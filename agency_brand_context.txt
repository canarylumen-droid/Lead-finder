## 3. COLD OUTREACH STRATEGY (The "Soft Yes")
**Rule #1:** NEVER ask for a meeting in the first email.
**Rule #2:** NEVER send a payment link in the first email.
**Goal:** Get them to reply "Sure" or "Yes" (Micro-Commitment).

## 4. EMAIL SCRIPTS (For AI Training)

### CAMPAIGN 1: "THE REVAMP" (For Low Visibility Leads)
**Target:** Leads with an existing (but weak) website/low reviews.

**Email 1 (The Hook):**
Subject: your website / premium clients?

Hi {{firstName}},

I found your business while researching top-rated {{niche}} in {{location}}.

I noticed you have a few great reviews, but your current website doesn't really reflect the "Premium" quality of work I assume you do.

In my experience, an outdated site pushes away high-ticket clients and attracts "price shoppers" who just want the cheapest deal.

I actually mocked up a "Premium" version of your homepage that helps position you as the #1 authority in {{location}}.

Mind if I send the video breakdown over?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up 1 (2 Days Later):**
Subject: Re: your website / premium clients?

Did you catch my last note, {{firstName}}?

I promise I'm not trying to sell you generic SEO. We prefer to just help expert {{niche}} pros look like the Market Leaders they actually are.

Happy to send that example over if you're open to it?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up 2 (4 Days Later):**
Subject: quick question

One last idea—if you're happy with your current lead volume, I totally get it.

But if you ever decide you want to attract higher-paying jobs (instead of just more jobs), let's chat.

I'll leave you to it!

Best,
[Your Name]

### CAMPAIGN 2: "THE GHOST" (For No-Website Leads)
**Target:** Leads with NO website found.

**Email 1 (The Discovery):**
Subject: Question for {{companyName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I found your number on Google Maps while looking for a {{niche}} in {{location}}, but I hit a dead end trying to find your website.

Are you fully booked right now, or are you open to taking on more clients?

I actually built a quick demo of what a "High-Trust" site could look like for you (it helps customers verify you before they call).

Mind if I send the video over?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up 1 (2 Days Later):**
Subject: Re: Question for {{companyName}}

Just checking in on this? I promise I’m not trying to be a pest.

I just hate seeing solid local businesses lose leads to competitors solely because they "look" more established online.

Let me know if you want to see that demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

## 5. OBJECTION HANDLING (AI Instructions)

**If they say "How much?":**
"We keep it simple. A full 'Positioning Package' (Site + Reputation Setup) is a one-time flat fee of $300. No monthly retainers. Want to see exactly what's included?"

**If they say "I don't need a website":**
"Totally fair. But consider this: 80% of homeowners check Google before calling. Even a simple 'Business Card' site can increase your trust factor massive. It's not about being fancy, it's about being verified."

**If they say "Send the info":**
"Great! Here is the video breakdown I mentioned: [Link]. It shows exactly how we turn 'Browsers' into 'Buyers'. Watch it and let me know if you think that style would work for you?"
