## CAMPAIGN A: "THE REVAMP" (For Low Visibility Leads)
# Target: Has website, but < 20 reviews or bad design.
# Goal: Sell "Premium Positioning" ($300-$500).

**Email 1 (The Hook):**
Subject: your website / premium clients?

Hi {{firstName}},

I found your business while researching top-rated {{niche}} in {{location}}.

I noticed you have a few great reviews, but your current website doesn't really reflect the "Premium" quality of work I assume you do.

In my experience, an outdated site pushes away high-ticket clients and attracts "price shoppers" who just want the cheapest deal.

I actually mocked up a "Premium" version of your homepage that helps position you as the #1 authority in {{location}}.

Mind if I send the video breakdown over?

Best,

Did you catch my last note, {{firstName}}?

I promise I'm not trying to sell you generic SEO. We prefer to just help expert {{niche}} pros look like the Market Leaders they actually are.

Happy to send that example over if you're open to it?

Best,
[Your Name]

One last idea—if you're happy with your current lead volume, I totally get it.

But if you ever decide you want to attract higher-paying jobs (instead of just more jobs), let's chat.

I'll leave you to it!

## CAMPAIGN B: "THE GHOST" (For No-Website Leads)
# Target: NO Website found.
# Goal: Sell "Instant Authority" Site ($300).

**Email 1 (The Discovery):**
Subject: Question for {{companyName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I found your business on Google Maps while looking for a {{niche}} in {{location}}, but I couldn't find your website.

Are you fully booked right now, or are you open to taking on more clients?

I actually built a quick demo of what a "High-Trust" site could look like for you (it helps customers verify you before they call).

Mind if I send the video over?

Best,

Just checking in on this? I promise I’m not trying to be a pest.

I just hate seeing solid local businesses lose leads to competitors solely because they "look" more established online.

Let me know if you want to see that demo?

Best,
[Your Name]
